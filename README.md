# burger

In this assignment, I created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Node and MySQL were used to query and route data into the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML on the page.

The user can add burgers to a list, which populates fields on the left side of the page and inserts rows into the burgers_db database. If the user chooses to eat one, they can do so using the "devour!" button, and the burgers will move over to the right side of the app (on full screen) and turn a different background color.
